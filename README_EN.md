  </p>

## 😩 The Problem

Every Friday afternoon, the same question hits you — what did I actually do this week?

You open the calendar, scroll through tasks, search keywords in group chats… 30 minutes later, you haven't even started writing the retro. And those action items from last sprint? Who even remembers?

That's why I built lark-retro: **one sentence, and it automatically pulls data, generates a report, and tracks action items. It even books your next meeting room.**

## 🎬 Demo

</p>

## 🧭 Before / After

Before:

- Work evidence is scattered across Calendar, Minutes, Tasks, chats, and historical docs, so every retro starts with manual archaeology.
- Reports easily become "it felt busy this week" without concrete meeting, task, or blocker evidence.
- Previous action items are tracked from memory, and cross-cycle follow-through gets lost.
- Meeting recordings require a separate manual search when calendar events do not expose minutes directly.

After:

- One sentence triggers a data-backed chain across Calendar, Meeting Records, Tasks, Messages, Docs, and Whiteboards.
- Reports include data quality notes: what was collected, what was missing, and what degraded because of permissions or empty results.
- Action items can be created, commented, closed, or archived to Bitable, with user confirmation before every write.
- The next retro can continue tracking previous commitments and check candidate rooms for the next session.

## 🆕 v2.6 Highlights (Assessed through lark-cli v1.0.21)

- **Multi-room-name lookup (v1.0.21)** — `calendar +room-find --room-name "01,02,03"` can search several preferred room names at once before the user confirms the next retro booking.
- **Calendar search and table output (v1.0.21)** — `calendar events search_event` can look for an existing next retro before creating a duplicate, while `calendar +create --format table` gives a cleaner confirmation output.
- **OKR progress read enrichment (v1.0.21)** — `okr +progress-list` / `+progress-get` can enrich OKR analysis with real progress records; create/update/delete progress commands remain explicit write actions outside the default flow.
- **Slides comments and contact filters were evaluated (v1.0.21)** — They are useful general-office capabilities, but weaker fits for the default retro path, so they stay as optional side context rather than main workflow steps.
- **Prefer Drive search for historical retros (v1.0.20)** — `drive +search` can narrow by "mine / edited / commented", folder, wiki space, and doc type, making it a better first pass before falling back to `docs +search`.
- **Message search can filter by @mentions (v1.0.20)** — `im +messages-search --is-at-me / --at-chatter-ids` helps reduce blocker-search noise when the user wants only messages that mention a specific person.
- **Next retro events can be edited in place (v1.0.20)** — `calendar +update` lets the agent change title, time, or description on an already-created retro event instead of recreating it.
- **Historical doc permission fallback (v1.0.17)** — When a previous retro or wiki doc is located but unreadable, `drive +apply-permission` can optionally request `view/edit` access from the owner; lark-retro treats this as an explicit user-approved fallback, not a default action.
- **Action-item record share links (v1.0.17)** — After archiving action items to Bitable, `base +record-share-link-create` can generate direct links for one or many records so the retro doc or notification can point straight at the stored items.
- **Whiteboard image insertion was evaluated but not promoted into the main retro path (v1.0.17)** — It is more of a presentation enhancement than a retro-core capability, so it stays outside the one-sentence default flow.
- **Approval blocker enrichment (v1.0.15)** — Optionally read `approval instances initiated` / `approval tasks query` so pending approvals can appear as external dependencies or blockers in the retro; this stays read-only by default.
- **Approval reminders stay out of the default flow (v1.0.15)** — `approval tasks remind` is a dangerous write action and is only allowed when the user explicitly asks to nudge approvers and confirms the instance code / task IDs.
- **Spreadsheet floating images were evaluated but not promoted into the main retro path (v1.0.15)** — `sheets +create-float-image` and related shortcuts are useful for dashboards, but they do not improve the core retro loop enough to justify extra complexity.

- **OKR Alignment (v1.0.14)** — Optionally read `okr +cycle-list` / `okr +cycle-detail` to compare meetings, tasks, blockers, and outcomes against objectives and key results; missing OKR scopes degrade gracefully.
- **Wiki Space Bootstrap (v1.0.14)** — Use `wiki spaces create` to initialize a team retro knowledge space for first-time setup or contest demos; real creation requires explicit confirmation of name and sharing mode.
- **Report Media Embedding (v1.0.14)** — Use `docs +media-insert --file-view card|preview|inline` to attach exported PDFs, recordings, or supporting files as cards, preview players, or inline blocks.
- **Report Folder Auto-create (v1.0.13)** — Use `drive +create-folder` before creating shortcuts so users do not need to prepare a folder token manually.
- **User-identity Rich Media Notifications (v1.0.13)** — Use `im +messages-send --as user --file/--image/--audio/--video` to send report attachments from the user's own account; paths must be relative to the current directory, and bot Markdown remains the default.
- **Tasklist Custom Sections (v1.0.10)** — Use `task +tasklist-task-add --section-guid` to place action items into a specific tasklist section, while explicitly checking `failed_tasks` so `ok: true` does not hide a failed section add.
- **Report Shortcuts (v1.0.10)** — Use `drive +create-shortcut` to place a report entry in a team/project folder after the report doc is generated.
- **Drive Title Patching (v1.0.10)** — Use `drive files patch` to align report titles with team naming conventions after creation.
- **Wiki Member Read-only Preflight (v1.0.10)** — Use `wiki members list` to inspect target wiki visibility; member add/remove remains a high-risk admin action and is not part of the default retro flow.
- **Meeting Recording Search (v1.0.9)** — Use `vc +search` to find meeting recordings by time range, keyword, participant, or room, filling gaps when calendar events do not expose a `minute_token`.
- **Meeting Notes Enrichment (v1.0.9)** — Use `vc +notes` to retrieve `note_doc_token` / `verbatim_doc_token` for relevant meetings, so the retro can cite concrete decisions, follow-ups, and open questions.
- **Book Next Retro Room (v1.0.8)** — Suggests next time slot and uses `calendar +room-find` to find available rooms before user-confirmed booking.
- **Archive Action Items to Bitable (v1.0.8)** — Support syncing items to Bitable tables via `base +record-batch-create`.
- **Whiteboard Context Analysis (v1.0.8)** — Use `whiteboard +query` to export brainstorm boards as background input for the report.
- **Meeting Minutes Analysis (v1.0.7)** — Automatically analyze linked Feishu Minutes for deeper meeting insights.

## 🪽 Hermes Agent Support

`lark-retro` uses the standard `SKILL.md` layout and is compatible with the Hermes Agent Skills system. For the most reliable setup, point Hermes' external skill directory at this repository's `skills` folder rather than the repository root:

```yaml
skills:
  external_dirs:
    - /path/to/lark-retro/skills
```

After that, Hermes should discover the `lark-retro` skill. The repository still keeps the default `npx skills add` installation path for Codex, Cursor, Claude Code, Trae, and similar agent tools.

## ✅ Verified Capabilities

> The core v2.6.7 retro flow was regression-tested on a real Feishu account. For v1.0.21 specifically, `calendar +room-find --room-name` and `calendar +create --format table` were exercised for real, while `calendar events search_event` and OKR progress commands were verified through boundary behavior.

### Full E2E Verified

- ✅ `calendar +agenda` / `minutes minutes get` — Calendar & Minutes (v1.0.7)
- ✅ `calendar +room-find --room-name "01,02,03"` — Real multi-room-name lookup executed and returned `ok: true`; no concrete room candidates still leaves a valid `time_slots` result. (v1.0.21)
- ✅ `calendar +create --format table` — Real calendar creation with table output, useful for confirming event_id / start / end / summary on stage. (v1.0.21)
- ✅ `calendar +update` / `calendar events get` / `calendar events delete` — Real next-retro event create/update/read/delete loop. (v1.0.20)
- ✅ `vc +search` / `vc +notes` / `docs +fetch` — Meeting recording search, meeting-note token retrieval, and note body fetch (v1.0.9)
- ✅ `docs +search --filter` — Precise doc search (v1.0.7)
- ✅ `wiki +node-create` — Wiki node management (v1.0.7)
- ✅ `task +get-my-tasks` / `task +create` — Tasks
- ✅ `task +complete` / `task +comment` — Task closure/notes
- ✅ `task +tasklist-task-add` — Add action items to a tasklist; the `--section-guid` parameter and `failed_tasks` failure boundary were verified. (v1.0.10)
- ✅ `base +record-share-link-create` — Real Bitable record share-link generation verified; duplicate IDs were deduplicated and mixed valid/invalid IDs kept the valid result. (v1.0.17)
- ✅ `drive files patch` — Drive doc title patching. (v1.0.10)
- ✅ `drive +create-shortcut` / `drive files list` / `drive +delete` — Report shortcut creation, verification, and cleanup. (v1.0.10)
- ✅ `wiki members list` — Wiki member read-only preflight. (v1.0.10)
- ✅ `im +messages-send --as bot` — Bot messages
- ✅ `im +chat-messages-list` — Group message history

### Command Verified + Permission/Parameter Boundary Verified

- ⚠️ `calendar +room-find` — Room candidate lookup command and parameter shape verified; actual booking requires user confirmation and the calendar creation flow. (v1.0.8)
- ⚠️ `calendar events search_event` — A temporary event created immediately before search returned 0 results, so event search has index-delay behavior; fall back to `calendar +agenda` for same-window title filtering. (v1.0.21)
- ⚠️ `okr +progress-list` / `+progress-get` / `+progress-create` — Command surface verified; the current account lacks `okr:okr.progress:readonly` / `okr:okr.progress:writeonly`, so lark-retro keeps progress writes out of the default path. (v1.0.21)
- ⚠️ `contact +search-user --has-chatted` — Command and dry-run payload verified; real account results were empty, so this remains an optional contact-resolution helper, not a core retro step. (v1.0.21)
- ⚠️ `drive +search` — Real `--mine`, `--created-since`, `--edited-since`, and `--folder-tokens` searches were run against temporary fixtures, but the test account still returned 0 results; treat it as a better first-pass filter, not the only historical-doc path. (v1.0.20)
- ⚠️ `im +messages-search --is-at-me` / `--at-chatter-ids` — Real account queries returned `items: []` for the tested time window, so these flags are documented as noise-reduction filters rather than proof that no discussion happened. (v1.0.20)
- ⚠️ `task +tasklist-task-add --section-guid` — Command and failure boundary verified; real custom-section writes require an existing user-provided `section_guid`. (v1.0.10)
- ⚠️ `base +record-batch-create` — Batch write command and payload shape verified; real writes require a target `base_token` / `table_id`. (v1.0.8)
- ⚠️ `base +record-share-link-create` — Official reference and response shape were checked; useful after Bitable archiving, but intentionally not auto-shared. (v1.0.17)
- ⚠️ `drive +export` — Document export to Markdown command verified; real export requires readable source documents and export permissions.
- ⚠️ `drive +apply-permission` — A real API call against an owned temp doc returned `1063007 Pointless authorized request`, matching the documented non-applicable boundary; a successful owner-request path still requires a genuinely inaccessible-but-requestable doc. (v1.0.17)
- ⚠️ `drive +create-folder` — Report folder creation dry-run verified; omitting `--folder-token` falls back to the caller's root folder, and real creation requires target-location confirmation. (v1.0.13)
- ⚠️ `whiteboard +query` — Whiteboard raw/image query command verified; real analysis requires a valid `whiteboard_token`. (v1.0.8)
- ⚠️ `wiki members create/delete` — Command, scope, and dry-run verified; real member changes affect wiki access and are intentionally outside the default retro flow. (v1.0.10)
- ⚠️ `okr +cycle-list` / `okr +cycle-detail` — Command shape and missing-scope boundary verified; real OKR reads require `okr:okr.period:readonly` / `okr:okr.content:readonly`. (v1.0.14)
- ⚠️ `approval instances initiated` / `approval tasks query` / `approval tasks remind` — Official release, schema, and scope boundaries were checked; only the first two are considered part of the retro's read-only blocker analysis. (v1.0.15)
- ⚠️ `wiki spaces create` — Dry-run request shape verified; real creation adds a new wiki space and requires explicit confirmation. (v1.0.14)
- ⚠️ `docs +media-insert --file-view preview` — Media view dry-run verified; real insertion requires a valid doc and a local relative-path attachment. (v1.0.14)

## 🔒 Safety Boundaries

- **Read first, write only after confirmation** — lark-retro collects Calendar, Task, Message, Doc, and Meeting Record data for analysis; creating docs, tasks, Bitable records, group notifications, or room bookings requires user confirmation.
- **No credential storage** — Feishu/Lark auth stays in `lark-cli`; the Skill does not store access tokens or ask users to paste secrets.
- **Careful meeting-record handling** — content from `vc +notes` / `docs +fetch` is used as report input; test logs only record status such as `has_content`, not meeting body text.
- **Graceful permission fallback** — missing scopes such as `search:message`, `vc:record:readonly`, or `docs:document.content:read` skip only the affected module and are called out in the report.
- **Wiki member management stays read-only by default** — v1.0.10 `wiki members create/delete` is never executed silently; lark-retro only uses `wiki members list` as a visibility preflight unless the user explicitly asks for admin changes.
- **OKR is read-only enrichment** — v1.0.14 OKR data is used only for alignment analysis; lark-retro never modifies objectives or key results.
- **Approval stays read-only by default** — v1.0.15 `approval instances initiated` / `approval tasks query` are used only to identify blockers and external dependencies; `approval tasks remind` is disabled unless the user explicitly asks for it.
- **Permission requests require confirmation** — v1.0.17 `drive +apply-permission` sends a real request card to the owner, so it is only used after explicit user approval.
- **Record share links are not auto-broadcast** — v1.0.17 `base +record-share-link-create` is used only when the user explicitly wants direct record links attached to the retro output.
- **Wiki space creation requires confirmation** — `wiki spaces create` creates real spaces, so lark-retro only dry-runs or executes after explicit user confirmation.
- **Media uploads require confirmation** — `docs +media-insert` and `im +messages-send --as user --file/--image/...` upload local files, so the file path, recipient, and purpose must be shown first.
- **No silent external actions** — `im +messages-send`, `base +record-batch-create`, and the room-booking flow after `calendar +room-find` are never executed silently.
